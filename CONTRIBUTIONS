Contributions
=============

OpenFOAM is a project that is the work of multiple people and their effort
should not be ignored.


General
-------

Generally, you can look at the Git commit history to see who contributed
to the code base, with the main repositories being found here:

MacOS X
-------

For MacOS X specific contributions, the efforts started out in the form
of patches, that had been posted and referenced in the following places:
 
  - http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-installation-windows-mac/114265-patches-compile-openfoam-2-2-mac-os-x.html

A few of the names, that could be identified as missing from the Git
contribution for the MacOS X fork (likely incomplete):

  Bernhard F.W. Gschaider, Hrvoje Jasak, Michael Wild, Doug Hunsaker,
  Simon Stapleton, Bouke, James Turner, Petr Vita, Jonathan Stickel,
  many others.
  
Also, since the main repository only focus on the Linux specific code
base, the following repository currently covers the MacOS X specific
changes:
